# natours

This is the first project in Jonas Schmedtmann's course in advanced CSS and Sass; it involves building a website using advanced CSS properties and SCSS compilation.

The beginning involves creating a header using properties such as clip-path, transform, keyframe animations, hover effects, box-shadow, and pseudo-elements.

The second section consists of lectures about how CSS works behind the scenes and about good coding principles, including a discussion about writing code that conforms to Block__Element--Modifier (BEM) and Don't-Repeat-Yourself (DRY) methodology.

The third section is an introduction to SCSS/Sass and npm. This project uses two npm packages: node-sass as a developer dependency and live-server to display the page.

After refactoring the Natours code to use SCSS, BEM principles, and DRY principles we create an organizational file system for the SCSS code and move code into the appropriate folders and subfolders.

We then continue building the Natours website using a float layout with a grid. The About section uses WebKit-background-clip and skew to create a unique heading. There is also another animated button and images that animate on hover. The Features section includes animated information-boxes, as does the Tours section. We also use background-blend-mode to blend a linear color gradient with images.

The Stories section used the shape-outside property to make text float around a circular image, and the object-fit property adds an opaque background video - a really stunning effect!

The Booking section features a solid linear gradient between a form and an image, some animation effects on a form, and customized, styled radio buttons.
