This is the first project in Jonas Schmedtmann's course in advanced CSS and Sass; it involves building a website using advanced CSS properties.

The beginning involves creating a header using properties such as clip-path, transform, keyframe animations, hover effects, box-shadow, and pseudo-elements.

The second section contains lectures on how CSS works behind the scenes and about good coding principles, including a discussion about writing code that conforms to Block__Element--Modifier (BEM) methodology.

The third section is an introduction to SCSS/Sass and npm. The project uses node-sass as a developer dependency and live-server to display the page.
