This is part one of Jonas Schmedtmann's course in advanced CSS and Sass; it involves building a website using advanced CSS properties.

The beginning involves creating a header using properties such as clip-path, transform, keyframe animations, hover effects, box-shadow, and pseudo-elements.

There are also lectures on how CSS works behind the scenes and about good coding principles, including a discussion about writing code that conforms to Block__Element--Modifier (BEM) methodology.
